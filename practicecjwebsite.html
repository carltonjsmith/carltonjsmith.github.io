					<p>
						I am Carlton John Smith Jr. I am a second year undergraduate student at the University of Florida is majoring in physics with considerable coursework in mathematics, computer science, and biology. Of particular interest to me is the
						intersection of the physical sciences with the biologi sciences.
						In the past I've conducted research using statistical, mathematical, and computational approaches to characterize
						wildfire frequency. Prior to that I researched the effects of the insertion of enzymes into pot soil's effect on
						plant growth. Additionally, I have a passion for STEM outreach, as evidenced my role as a teacher's assistant.
					</p>
					<p>
						I attended Fort Pierce Central High School in Fort Pierce, Florida from August 2014 to May 2018. There I studied
						a multitude of subjects at collegiate-level. I graduated from this institution with high honors, a 5.6 weighted
						grade point average, a 4.0 unweighted grade point average, and a ranking of 6 out of 652 students. I also attended
						Indian River State college in Fort Pierce, Florida from June 2015 to April 2018. I enrolled in advanced-level
						science and mathematics courses while there. I graduated from Indian River State College in April 2018 with summa-cum-laude
						distinction and a 4.0 grade point average.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my free time you can catch me listening to music (90's R & B, 80's, 70's, jazz, gospel, baroque classical), reading science-fiction
						(I am a big fan of space operas.), watching horror movies, running, and/or spending time with family and friends.
