Hi, I am Carlton Smith! I am a physics graduate student and  NSF and Wu Tsai Graduate Fellow at Yale University interested
in the application of physical techniques and concepts to neuroscience specifically and biology broadly.
For a bit of background, I studied at and graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelor of Science in Physics
and a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics. Currently, I study the statistical physics of neural systems as a part of Dr. Christopher Lynn's
<a href="https://lynnlab.yale.edu/">SPâ†‘N Lab</a> at Yale University. I most recently had the privilege of working with <a href="https://www.saxenalab.org/">Dr. Shreya Saxena's Lab of Neural Control</a>,
where I developed dimensionality-reduction methods used to characeterize the variability in neural acticity across subjects and within
subjects during the learning of a decision-making task. Before that, I helped characterize the behavior of models of synaptic plasticity under
the instruction of Dr. Dmitri Chklovskii and Dr. David Lipshutz through the Simons-NSBP Scholars Program. Prior, I engaged in research
in image denoising and machine learning for material characterization as a part of NYU's CDS Undergraduate Research Program, working under the instruction of
Dr. Carlos Fernandez-Granda.
                </p>
								<p>
Additionally, I have been a NSBP Student Council member since 2022, where, as a member of the Programs Committee, I currently co-organize programs such as the <a href="https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/nsbp-innovate-seminar-series"> KITP-NSBP Innovate Seminar Series</a>
or NSBP Visions Series.
								</p>
                <p>
                    In my free time you can catch me cooking, listening to music, practicing my bass or guitar, reading, or exploring cityscapes!
