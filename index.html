Hello, I am Carlton Smith! I am a senior undergraduate
physics and math student at the University of Florida.  For a bit of
background, I entered UF with an interest in planetary science and astronomy,
allured by the opportunity to contribute to our mapping of space, 'the final
frontier'. Steadily, as time has progressed I've grown interested in the
physics of complex systems, especially those found in living matter. In the
later portion of my undergraduate, I've had the privilege of working in
research experiences related to deep learning, image denoising, machine
learning, and neuroscience. To be more specific, my current research involves
algorithmically visualizing and measuring the similarity between spatial
components of neural activity across sessions and specimens.  My research
interests include theoretical and computational biophysics and neuroscience -
specifically, applications of statsitical physics to studying complex
biological systems.

                    In my free time you can catch me cooking, listening to music, practicing my bass or guitar, reading, or exploring cityscapes!
